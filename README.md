# Password Manager

A secure and user-friendly password manager application built using Python and Tkinter. This application allows you to generate, store, retrieve, update, delete, and manage your passwords efficiently. It uses the `cryptography` library to encrypt and decrypt your saved passwords for enhanced security.
